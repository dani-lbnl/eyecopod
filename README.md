Watch out for our planet and use computer vision for climate change!
This is a story of investigating computational schemes based on Computer Vision algorithms to better understand plant photography and imaging from non-conventional imaging: EcoPOD, EcoFAB and EcoBOT. Why? Because measuring plant development helps to understand how to increase food production, how to minimize waste, and how to see the impact to our environment. 

These notebooks are designed to solve problems using scientific data, both publicly available as well as data acquired using advanced instruments at DOE national labs.
